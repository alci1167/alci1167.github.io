                <h4>DESCRIPTION </h4>

                <p>
                    In this lab, we will be working with motors. We will be working with two types of motors in our kit for this lab - the servo motor and the DC motor.
                    We will be connecting these to our Arduino boards in different ways and controlling them using the potentiometer and the joystick, and finally make an oscillating toy fan. 
                </p>

            <h4>PART 0: SETTING UP POWER</h4>
            <p>
                Trying to power motors from the Arduino can burn out the Arduino pins, and sometimes even the USB port on your computer.
                So we will be using the 9V battery along with the power supply module from our kit to power the motors we use in this lab. 
            </p>

            <h4>PART 1: WIRING THE SERVO</h4>
            <p>
                In the first part of this lab, we will connect the servo motor from our kits to the Arduino.
                After we set up the motor power using the power supply module, we can connect the power and ground to the 5V rails.
                The signal line of the servo should connect to a PWM pin on the Arduino. The PWM pins are the pins with a tilde or pins 11, 10, 9, 6, 5, and 3.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab6/servoSetup.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                Now that we have wired the servo, we can test it out. We do not need to use the usual analogWrite() function to send this PWM.
                There is a built-in Arduino library to control the servos, called "Servo.h". The "Servo.h" library comes pre-installed with most Arduino IDE installations.
                This is a screenshot showing the "Servo.h" library is installed.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab6/servoLibrarySS.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 80%">
            </div>

            <p>
                Now that we have set up the Servo library, we can go ahead and try out a sample code to move the servo.
                The code we will be using is a sample code called “Sweep” from the Arduino website, which simply moves the servo from 0° to 180°, and then back from 180° to 0°. 
            </p>

            <h4>PART 2: CONTROLLING THE SERVO</h4>
            <p>
                In this part of the lab, we will try to control the movement of the servo using a potentiometer. We will connect the potentiometer to the Arduino like we did in previous labs.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab6/potServoSetup.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                We can use the map() function to convert the analog potentiometer reading into an angle value and  move the servo in sync with the potentiometer. 
            </p>

            <div id = "images">
                <video width="520" height="440" class="feature" controls>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/alci1167/7672a1237efe2dc44ef68b2ffac4fb54.js"></script>

            <p>
                We can modify the previous code such that based on the input from the potentiometer, the delay period changes from 5ms to 50ms, which would be changing the speed of the servo.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 3: DC MOTOR AND MOTOR DRIVER</h4>

            <p>
                We can also use a DC motor. The DC motor in our kit is a small brushed DC motor. This motor can be fast enough to run a small fan.
            </p>


            <div id = "images">

            </div>

            <p>
                If we want to not only control whether the motor is on or not, but also its direction we need to use a motor driver.
                A motor driver is an Integrated Circuit (IC) that allows bidirectional control of motors with the help of transistors.
                In our kits, we have the L293D chip, which is a dual-channel motor driver that can control up to two motors.
                we can connect the L293D chip to our Arduino and the motor.
