            <h4>PART 1: USING A POTENTIOMETER</h4>
            <p>
                We will be using a potentiometer as a way to provide analog input to the Arduino.
                A potentiometer is a type of variable resistor that we can rotate or slide to provide a range of analog inputs to the Arduino.
                Since we are now measuring analog signals, we need to use one of the analog-enabled pins on the Arduino for measurement,
                which are labeled as A0-A5 on one side of our Arduino Uno board.
            </p>
            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab4/potSetup.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                We can perform measurements with the analog pins on the Arduino using the analogRead() function.
                Using this we can create an Arduino sketch that continuously prints the analog value of the potentiometer on the serial monitor.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 2: LIGHT 'EM UP WITH A POTENTIOMETER</h4>
            <p>
                In this part of the lab, we are going to use the potentiometer to create an interactive LED visualization.
                We can take 5 LEDs and arrange the linearly on the breadboard. The LEDs need to be set up tp be 
                individually digitally controlled using the digital I/O pins.
            </p>

            <div id="images">

            </div>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                We can Create a sketch such that no LEDs are turned on if the potentiometer is turned all the way to the left.
                As we slightly rotate the knob, one LED turns on. If we rotate it a little more, two LEDs turn on, and so on, until all the 5 LEDs are
                turned on when the potentiometer is dialed all the way to the other side.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 3: JOYSTICK FOR ARDUINO</h4>
            <p>
                After working with a potentiometer, we can now move on to an analog joystick. This joystick is simply two potentiometers and a push button combined into one.
                We can connect the joystick to the Arduino through the breadboard.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab4/joystickSetup.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                Now that we have connected the joystick to the Arduino, we can read its exact position.
                We will read the analog value of both the potentiometers in the joystick (x and y), 
                and print their values (labeled based on X or Y) to the serial monitor. 
            </p>

            <div id = "images">
                <video width="520" height="440" class="feature" controls>

            <h4>PART 4: LIGHT 'EM UP WITH A JOYSTICK</h4>
            <p>
                In this part of the lab, we will add another dimension to the LED visualization from part 2.
                We will use the joystick to light up the different LEDs. We can rearrange the 5 LEDs on the breadboard into a 'plus (+)' layout. 
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/lab4/joystickLights.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                Taking this further, we want to program the Arduino to control which LEDs get turned on based on the input from the joystick. 
            </p>

            
            <h4>PART 5: BASIC LED WHACK-A-MOLE</h4>
            <p>
                In this part of the lab, we will use the joystick and the plus-arrangement of the LEDs to create a simple whack-a-mole game.
            </p>

            <h4>CONCLUSION </h4>
