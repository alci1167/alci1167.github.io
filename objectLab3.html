                <h4>DESCRIPTION </h4>
                <p>In this lab we will learn how to solder. Soldering is a very useful electrical prototyping skill, which you will probably use in your labs and the final project.

            <h4>PART 1: SOLDERING SETUP AND SAFETY</h4>
            <p>Before beginning soldering, assemble all of these tools on your soldering station.The appropriate temperature for soldering is between 600 ℉ - 700 ℉ (325 ℃ - 375 ℃),
                 so ensure that the number on the screen that represents the current temperature of the iron is within this range. There are certain safety steps and precautions to take while soldering. These are:</p>
                 <ol>
                    <li>
                        <a>Make sure that you always grab the soldering iron using the handle and not the front metal part.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Never keep the soldering iron outside its stand; dont put it directly on the table or on some other surface.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Once the soldering iron is turned on, turn on the fume extractor fan.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Always remember to wash your hands with soap and water after soldering.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a>Always wear safety glasses while soldering to protect your eyes.</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h4>PART 2: SOLDERING WIRES TO PROTOBOARD</h4>
            <p>We will be using a Protoboard, which is used for electrical prototyping like a breadboard, but it can be soldered on.
                In this part of the lab we will be soldering wires to the protoboard. We will be using two types of wires: solid-core, and stranded.
                After turning the soldering iron on and getting it heated, we need to tin and clean the iron. We can now move on to stripping 2mm off the ends of our solid ann stranded wire.
                We can now solder the wires to the protoboard.
            </p>
            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/3wires.JPEG" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>
            <p>The solid-core wire was much easier to solder. The stranded wire was much more flimsy and the wires would move.</p>

            <h4>PART 3: BRIDGE OF SOLDER</h4>
            <p>A solder bridge is when we connect two adjacent holes on a protoboard using solder.
                We will connect the four joints we made in the previous part to each other by trace soldering.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h4>PART 4: SPLICING WIRES</h4>
            <p>For this part of the lab, we will splice the 4 pieces of wires to each other in order to make a longer (8-inch) piece of wire with three splice joints.</p>

            <h4>CONCLUSION </h4>
            <p>This lab was fun for me. I had some experience with soldering before, but not much. The hardest part was the bridging. 
                I was having a hard time geting the joints to connect. Overall it was an educational lab that helped be do some basic solering.
