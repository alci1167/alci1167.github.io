                <h3>006 - Project 4: Concrete Vessel</h3>

                <p>
                    My general idea of the vessel was a cup that looked like a coil wraped around. I used clay to model out the shape of my vessel.
                    I made a basic cup shape with the clay and rolled out strips that I wanted to wrap around the cup.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/concreteSketch.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 36%">
                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_2692.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_2693.JPG" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">

                </div>

                <p>
                    I then baked the cup and used it as the mold for the concrete vessel. To make a mold out of the cup, I had to make a container to pour the silicone. 
                    I made this container with acrylic and hot glue.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_0246.JPEG" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_2694.JPG" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">


                </div>

                <p>
                    After testing the container for leaks, I placed the clay model in the container and poured the silicone solution.
                    I used a kit I found to make the silicone
                    It took about 30 minutes for the mold to dry. Once dried, I removed the silicone mold from the acrylic container.
                    I then removed the model and the mold was ready to be used. 
                </p>

                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_2695.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">

                    <img src="/img/concreteProject/IMG_0276.JPEG" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">


                </div>

                <p>
                    I used a ready to use concrete patch mix. I used this concrete because it was the first thing I found when I went to the store. I wasn't really sure if this was goint to work.
                    After mixing the concrete, I poured it into the mold. Now I needed to wait for the concrete to set.

                <p>
                    Overall this project helped me learn a lot of things about molding. It is a pretty simple idea, but it can help ypu make quality pieces very fast and efficiently.
