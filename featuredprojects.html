                <p>
                    The remote controlled car was developed as a team project for "Form" at ATLS.
                    To create a more interactive experience, we also developed a laser gate and display to track lap times.

                <p>
                    "Mexican Athletes" attempts to bring recongition to sucessful Mexican athletes. The initial idea was to inspire the next generation of athletes.

                <p>
                    "Go-Kart" was created using SketchUp. This kart was designed as a "possible" addition to Mario Kart.

                </div>

                <p>
                    The Shelf was the final project of "Form". The project involved creating a physical object with our new skills.
                    This shelf was a large project that I designed with a medium I've never used before.
