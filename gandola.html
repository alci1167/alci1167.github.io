                <h3>004 - Project 3: Plastic gandola</h3>

                <p>
                    I used HDPE and PETE plastic for my gandola. I got a PETE container of apple-pears that had three slots and seemed perfect for the project.
                    I also used a PETE plastic that came from Chromebook screens. I used PETE water bottles and PE-LD(LDPE) bags from the Chromebook screens.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2659.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 50%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    After having all the materials, I made a sketch of what I had in mind. All I honestly knew was that the apple-pear container was going to be the main structure.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/Untitled-Artwork (4).jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 50%">
                </div>

                <p style = "text-align:center;">
                    I cleaned the plastic materials and was ready to work on the gandola.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2662.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 50%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    I wedged in the water bottles into the contaier by cutting into the middle and making cuts around in a circle. 
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2663.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 50%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    I cut the bottles in half and stuffed the ends into the top half of the water bottles. I also used the other half of the apple-pear container and cut slits into it to be able to easily place the eggs.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2665.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2666.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                </div>


                <p>
                    I then poked holes on the top of the container and used strips of the bag to make a hinge. I used the blue plastic bags and PETE plastic to stuff the containers. To hang on the wire I made a handle by poking holes and using the a strip of PETE plastic as the handle. 
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2667.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/gandolaPics/IMG_2668.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                </div>

                <p style = "text-align:center;">
                    The final product seems pretty solid and should safely hold all three eggs. 
                </p>
