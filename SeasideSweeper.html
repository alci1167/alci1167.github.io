                Beaches are filthy. If you have ever been by the seaside, you have surely seen plastic littering the sands which is not only saddening to see, but tragic for marine life. 
                What if there was a way you could help and learn some new skills while you do?

                Seaside Sweeper represents the culmination of our love of the beach and our desire to help anyone get into the fascinating world of electronics. 
                For under $450, you can put together your very own beach cleaning robot. The Seaside Sweeper can navigate within a geofence you set or you can take control of the cleaning with a remote control. 
                Our easy-to-follow Instructables will guide you along every step of the way, showing you how to do everything from setting up the 3D prints to putting each wire in the right spot for the electronics. 
                We wanted to make building a beach cleaning robot affordable, reproducible, and educational - we hope that you find that it is all those things as you craft your own!

                The Seaside Sweeper resulted from countless hours of research & development, experimentation, and fun! 
                We iterated from a few pieces of plywood and cardboard to a marriage of multiple 3D-printed layers and electronics that practically puts itself together - both the process itself and the end result were incredibly rewarding. 
                With that said, we know the Seaside Sweeper can get even better - we view our work as the first step towards an affordable, robotic fleet of beach cleaners. 
                If you are reading this, make an improvement to our project and share it with others. Together, we can make the world a cleaner place!

                The Seaside Sweeper project was a collaboration with Emily Henderson, Ashlyn Duy, and Chi Chi Kari. 
                The group divided the work and my main contributions were with the fabrication of the robot.
                Collaboration with the team lead to various prototypes which ultimately resulted in the body for the robot. 
                Apart from some low fidelity prototypes with card board, the main tools used for this process were CAD and 3D printed components.
