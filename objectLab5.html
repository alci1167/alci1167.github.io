                    We will create some complex output from the Arduino in two contexts - visual and sound.</p>

            <h4>PART 1: WIRING UP THE RGB LED</h4>
            <p>
                In the first part of the lab, we will connect the RGB LED from our kits to the Arduino. An RGB LED is a red, a green, and a blue LED put together in one.
                In the RGB LED the longest leg is for ground, which is also the second pin from the flat side of the LED bulb. We can use a 220 ohm resistor for each color, so three 220 ohm resistors in total.
            </p>
            <div id="images">

                <img src="/img/lab5/rgbLEDcircuit1.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <p>
                Using analogWrite(), we can create a new Arduino sketch to control the brightness of the R, G, and B LEDs inside the RGB LED to produce different colors.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 2: DYNAMIC COLOR CHANGER WITH JOYSTICK</h4>
            <p>
                In this part, we will use the analog joystick to change the colors produced on the RGB LED. We will connect the joystick to the Arduino as we did in the previous lab.
                Since the joystick has two potentiometers for the x and y directions, we can map the two potentiometer values along the two axes to two of the three colors in the RGB color space. 
            </p>

            <h4>PART 3: MUSICAL NOTES WITH PASSIVE BUZZER</h4>
            <p>
                In this part of the lab, we will be using the passive buzzer to generate different sounds. We need to note that the buzzer has polarity, so we need to make sure 
                that we plug the positive to positive and negative to negative or we will damage it. We will connect the passive buzzer to the Arduino such that the positive terminal 
                (with the + icon) is wired to a digital pin and the negative terminal is connected to the ground.
            </p>

            <p>
                To produce sound from our buzzer, we will be using the tone() function. We can create a simple Arduino sketch which plays a beep of frequency 440 Hz on the buzzer for 1 second,
                stops for 1 second, and then plays the beep again repeatedly.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 4: LIGHT 'EM UP WITH A JOYSTICK</h4>

            <p>
                After playing an individual musical note on the buzzer, we can use it to play an entire melody of a song. Using the table in the lab that
                shows the sequence of the notes in the melody, as well as the type of note and whether it is dotted or not, we can write an Arduino sketch that plays this melody on the passive buzzer.
            </p>

            <p>
                After playing a melody on the buzzer, we can create our own melody and play it. We can create a melody similar to the one above, with at least 10 notes. 
            </p>

            <h4>CONCLUSION </h4>
            <p>
                This lab gave me multiple problems throughout. In part 4, I was unable to get all of my lights to work. The code seems to be working properly for
                the home, right, and left LEDs, but not for the top and bottom. I double checked the analog values, switched the LEDs and re-wired the circuit,
                but I wasn't able to figure it out. Overall, I thought this lab was very informative and I learned a lot from it.
