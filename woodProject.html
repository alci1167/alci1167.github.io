                <h3>003 - Project 1: Wood Polygon</h3>

                <p>
                    I had a very ambitious idea for this project. I initially wanted to do a truncated icosahedron which is the same shape that a soccer ball has.
                    The shape consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. A quick Wikipedia search told me the angles needed to put this pieces together. This ended up neing the reason
                    why I could not complete the truncated icosahedron.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started the project by spliting my pieces of maple and pine wood in half on the table saw. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then laser cut a pentagon and hexagon from acrylic to use as a template to draw on top of the wood.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2552.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="aboutflex2" style="width: 50%">

                <p>
                    Using these outlines, I cut the pieces out with the band saw. I tried to leave a good amount of space between where I cut and the shapes so I could sand 
                    them down to the edges. 
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2551.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2553.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2554.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    After sanding them and getting the basic shape down I made a "jig" to cut out the angles from both the hexagons and pentagons. This did not end up working very well.
                    I was unable to make a "jig" that helped all shapes have the appropriate angles. Since I was unable to do the cuts accurately, I could not make the truncated icosahedron.
                    I now had a bunch of hexagons and pentagons and had to come up with something else.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2556.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2557.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    I ended up staking the hexagons in groups of three and gluing them together. I then sanded the sides so the could sit flush next to eachother. I then glued the
                    pentagons in between these stacks.
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2560.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">
                </div>

                <p>
                    The final couple steps involved sanding. I could have done a better job at this, but I was honestly tired and ready to finish the piece. I finished this piece
                    with linseed oil. 
                </p>

                <div id = "images">
                    <img src="/img/woodPolygon/IMG_2565.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width: 40%">

                </div>

                <p>
                    Overall the project was challenging and I learned a lot of things. There are many thing I would do differently, but I think this was a good experience. 
                    I am proud of my work and hope to improve as I move along with this class.
