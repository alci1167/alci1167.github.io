                <h3>003 - Project 1: Wood Polygon</h3>

                <p>
                    I had a very ambitious idea for this project. I initially wanted to do a truncated icosahedron which is the same shape that a soccer ball has.
                    The shape consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. A quick Wikipedia search told me the angles needed to put this pieces together. This ended up neing the reason
                    why I could not complete the truncated icosahedron.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started the project by spliting my pieces of maple and pine wood in half on the table saw.

                    I then laser cut a pentagon and hexagon from acrylic to use as a template to draw on top of the wood.

                <p>
                    Using these outlines, I cut the pieces out with the band saw. I tried to leave a good amount of space between where I cut and the shapes so I could sand 
                    them down to the edges.
