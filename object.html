            <h4>PART 1: SETTING UP POWER</h4>
            <p>Using the power supply module, 830 Tie-Points Breadboard, Breadboard Jumper Wire, and the 9V Battery with Snap-on Connector Clip we can use the multimeter to test whether we are getting the expected power output on either side. The images below show how this was set up for both the 3.3V and 5V ouputs.</p>

            <h4>PART 2: (NOT) BLOWING UP AN LED</h4>
            <h3>3.3V Output</h3>
            <p>We are powering the LED with 3.3V source and our LED has a current of about 20 mA - 35 mA. Using Ohm's Law: R = 3.3V/30mA = 110 Ohm. This tells us we should use a 110 Ohm resistor. We have a 100 Ohm resitor that should work. The images below shows the schemtic and circuit.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>5V Output</h3>
            <p>The LED has a current of about 20 mA - 35 mA. Using Ohm's Law: R = 5V/30mA = 166.66 Ohm. This tells us we should use a 166 Ohm resistor. We have a 100 Ohm resitor and a 220 ohm resistor. With 100 Ohm the current would be 50 mA and with the 220 Ohm resistor the current would be 22 mA. The image below shows the schematic and circuit with a 220 Ohm resistor. </p>
            <div id = "images">

                <img src="/img/5led.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <h4>PART 3: SWITCHING THE LED</h4>
            <p>We set up the LED circuit with the 3.3V source and 100 Ohm resistor. We aslo incorporated the push button into the circuit such that the LED turns on only when you push the button, and stays off otherwise. The image and video below shows the schemtic and circuit.</p>

            <h4>EXTRA VOLT </h4>
            <p>This is the opposite of part 2. We can achieve this by putting the LED and the button in parallel. The image and video below shows the schemtic and circuit.</p>
            <div id = "images">

            <h4>CONCLUSION </h4>
            <p>The first lab went well. It was simple enough to get familiar with things. The only part we struggled with was with the breadboard. It was difficult to connect the LEDs and resistors, but I'm sure we will get the hang of it.</p>
