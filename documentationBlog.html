                The Iphone. More specifically, my Iphone is one of my favorite objects ever. It's a special object because it helps me stay connected to everything around the world.
                Sometimes a little too much. Although being stuck to my Iphone can be a bit unhealthy, I can’t help but constantly use it whenever I’m in trouble.
                This device gives me access to all the information in the world and has helped me solve many problems. The Iphone can be a very useful tool and we are lucky enough to be born at the same time this object was created.
                This crazy small computer sometimes doesn’t seem real. Even more so, what it's made of is something I can't put my head around.
                A quick google search can tell us the Iphone 12 is made out of Tungsten, plastic, tin, and other rare earth elements.
                Tons of testing and refinement combined with a lot of exploitation has given us an amazing tool we can use for just about anything.

                <h3>002 - Draw a tree</h3>

                    The European Larch tree I based my sketches on is in the middle of the CU Boulder Campus. A quick glance of the tree caught my eye. A lot of the beanches
                    were limp, causing it to look like a weeping tree. This to me gave it a lot of character and reminded me of trees I've seen in video games. The needles on the branches
                    were long and green. They were grouped on the branches but had a random feel to them. Some of the branches had small cones. The tree was tall and wide. It was in a group 
                    with other trees, but this European Larch stood out to me. At a closer look, the bark seemed familiar. It had shades of brown, grey, black, and white. The bark was easy to
                    peel and had brown patches where bark was. The tree was in a group with other trees, but this European Larch stood out to me.

                    Many films and videos help show the process of things being made. With how easily available these videos are, we often overlook the workmanship behind many of the things we love.
                    Industrialization has also caused quantity over quality, but glass blowing is something that continues to take time and put quality over quantity. 
                    "Glas" by Bert Haanstra is definitely worth a watch. It highlights the various stages of glassmaking in a factory. 
                    The entire film has jazz music playing over it. The music and the film alone are pleasing and fun to watch. When we combine the two you get something even more satisfying. 
                    The meticulous work that the glass blowers do, paired with the energy from the jazz music, create a great viewing experience that engages you with the music but keeps you intrigued with the visual process. 
                    The jazz music in the film can also be seen as an artistic connection. This artistic connection between the process of glass blowing and the creative, improvisational nature of jazz music could emphasize the artistic qualities of the glassmaking process. 
                    It can help show how much workmanship and skill goes into glass blowing as well as how much improvisation can be needed when working with glass or jazz.
