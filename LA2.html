            <h3>LA1: “Stringing Along”</h3>

            <p>
                This large assignment aims to give experience using parametric design to computationally 
                generate variations of a 3D design quickly and fabricating them. 
            </p>

            <h4>Task 1: Parametric 3D Designs</h4>

            <p>
                I used the riched graph mapper plug-in to give me better control of the shape of the vases. When I was working with the normal grpah mapper, I was struggling to get good shapes that I liked. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the following picture you can see the two graphs that control the the size of the circles that the vases are based on and the rotation of each circle. When we move these graphs around, we control the shape of the contures between the circles and the twists of the vases.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/gH2.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 40%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The following images show different variations that can be achieved. The riched graph mapper gives you the ability to control different sections of the model which allows for smoother contours and shapes.
                You can see on the third and fourth images the twisting that is also controlled with the riched graph mapper. 
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/vase1.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 20%">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/vase2.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 20%">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/vase3.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 20%">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/vase4.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 20%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The step and count sliders control the number of circles used to create the vase and the space between these circles. The following image shows a more squished vase that was achieved by lowering the step slider. 
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/gH1.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 30%">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/vase5.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 43.4%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The two sliders in the follwing image control the number of points that are connected to the circles which create the texture on the vases. With these sliders you can change how many indents there are and how deep the go.
                The image shows how the vases can look by changing these perameters compared to the previous image.  
            </p>

            <h4>Task 2: Creating a 3D-to-2D Slicer</h4>

            <p>
                The first shape I made was pretty basic. It had a couple curves that would make it aa bit more complicated.
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/brep.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 40%">
            </div>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/ghopper.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 70%">
            </div>

            <p>
                I used Brep to slice the solid. Since I made the solid horizontally I used a horizontal line from the ends of the solid to create the range for the planes.
                After slicing it I flattened all the shapes and spread them out.
            </p>
            
            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/allTheStuff.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 70%">
            </div>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/LA2pics/ghopper2.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 70%">
            </div>

            <p>
                After spreading the shapes out I added the numbers on each ranging from 0-15. I them baked them and exported the file. 
            </p>
