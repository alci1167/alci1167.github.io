                <h3>DAP-P3R</h3>
                <p>Idea to clean and upkeep the Denver Union Station. To solve this problem in the true style of speculative design, by fiction and imagination, we decided to build off of the well-known automatic household vacuum: the Roomba. Responsible for both vacuuming and standing as a reminder to throw away trash, DAP-P3R is guaranteed to keep Union Station consistently looking dapper</p>
