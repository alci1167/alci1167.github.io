            <p>
                The structural integrity of old furniture may be the main reason why it is discarded. 
                Replacement of structural components with 3D printed parts is a common solution. 
                Topology optimized 3D printed parts can provide the same functionality with less material. 
            </p>

                Image of chair I will be using. It is very worn down and was in my parents backyard made of metal. 
                I will be cutting off some parts of the chair and replacing them with 3D printed parts.
            </p>

            <div id="images">

                <img src="/img/CompFabFinal/chairSketches.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 40%">
            </div>

            <p style = "text-align:center;">
                I created a general box with measurements of the part I want to replace. 
            </p>

            <div id="images">
                <img src="/img/CompFabFinal/box.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 40%">
            </div>

            <p>
                I Populated random points within this box. This is parameterized and can change the number of points with the slider. 
                You can also change the seed, which gives another set of random points. Using Voronoi3D, I divided the box based on the points. 
                Voronoi3D divides the region based on all the points close to the seed which is the first random point I generated.

            <p>
                Once all these parameters are set we can create lines and connect them. I then used the mulipipe to give these lines a thickness. 
                The multipipe tool gives multiple parameters to control the look of the pipes. I capped the ends with a rounded shape.
            </p>

                This was the first part of the model. I added boxes to the ends of the structure. 
                This will be used to connect the 3D printed replacement part to the chair.

            </div>

            <p>
                I will add some sort of structure to the edges and perimeter of the box for some structural integrity. 
                I used the same voronoi structures to create the edges. This time I used the WeaverBird plug-in to connect the edges in loops.

            <p>
                Here are all elements together. I wanted to add some boxes to be able to slip in the part much easier but I was having trouble doing so.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are the two baked examples. I used boxes to make a hole in the initial base box, but when I baked it, the box had no thickness. 
                When I tested the model on the Prusa slicer it would not give the boxes thickness. I was able to bake it and use the shell comand from Rhino to open the box. 
                As an alternative to the voronoi edges, I also used the edges of the box and gave them a thickness using pipes. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Final part testing for 3D printing was not effecttive when printed horizontally. I rotated the design and the model printed well.

                Overall I enjoyed working on this project. I found it hard to connect the inner structure and the edges together. I tried singling out the enged of the inner structure and connecting them to the edges but it became to messy. I would have liked to see how it would look to add this piece to a chair, but I didn't want to cut up a chair for no reason. I enjoyed getting more familiar with grasshopper and it has a lot of features I would love to explore.
