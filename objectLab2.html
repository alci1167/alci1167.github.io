                <h3>Lab 2: Digital IO</h3>
                <h4>DESCRIPTION </h4>
                <p>This lab is an introduction to the Arduino, its Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and digital I/O on the Arduino.
                    We will set up the workflow of programming an Arduino and learn about how to manipulate and sense its digital pins.</p>

            <h4>PART 1: SETTING UP THE ARDUINO IDE</h4>
            <p>We will be using the Arduino microcontroller board, and we will be programming it using the Arduino IDE. 
                Using the IDE, we will write and upload code to the Arduino board. The first thing we are going to do is run the Blink example file.</p>

                </video>
            </div>

            <h4>PART 2: BLINKING AN EXTERNAL LED</h4>
            <p>Since We can control Arduino pins to output a certain voltage, we can use it to control an LED.
                We can take an LED and a resistor and connect them to the Arduino such that the LED is powered by the digital pin 10. We can do this by changing what pin we output to.</p>

            <h4>PART 3: BUTTON PRESS AND SERIAL MONITOR</h4>
            <p>Similar to how we set up a digital pin to be an OUTPUT in the previous part, we can also set one up to be an INPUT.
                This means that we will be able to detect whether the pin has HIGH or LOW voltage. 
                We can push a button connected to a digital input with a resistor to ground and add this to circuit to the LED circuit.</p>

            <h4 class="delay">Serial Monitor</h4>
            <p class="delay"> The Serial Monitor allows us to send bytes of data over a serial connection to print from the Arduino onto our computer. We can use Serial.println()
                to print a message on the seial monitor.
            </p>

                <img src="/img/ownMessage.JPG" alt="placeholder" class="feature">
            </div>

            <h4 class="delay">Serial Monitor "Waiting"</h4>
            <p class="delay"> Using the Serial Monitor we can print "Waiting" when the button is unpressd and print "Pushed" when the button is pressed.
                When the button is pressed we can see that the button state oscillates a few times even when presse once. This is due to mechanical and physical issues.
                We can use the millis() function to keep track of the time passed since the button was pressed.
            </p>

            <h4>PART 4: LED REACTION GAME</h4>
            <p>This game helps us put everything we've learned together into one project. The game is an LED reaction game.
                The LED connected to the Arduino will turn on after a random time interval, and then the player will need to press the button as soon as they notice the LED.
                The output is the time that the player took to press the button, which can serve as a score to compare with other players. The program goes trough these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The game begins with "Get ready to test your refelxes!" on the Serial Monitor.</li>
                <li>The Arduino outputs a “ready” message on Serial, to prepare the player for the be prepared to press the button. </li>
                <li>After the ready message, the Arduino waits for a random interval of time between 0.5s and 5s, and then turns on the LED.</li>
                <li>The player sees the LED turn on, and presses the button as fast as they can.</li>
                <li>Once the button is pressed, the LED turns off, and the Arduino outputs the time period the player
                took to respond from the moment the LED went on to the moment when the button was pressed</li>
                <li>This round is over. A delay of 5s starts after each round to make the player prepared for the next round. After 5s, the next round begins.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <h4>CONCLUSION </h4>
            <p>There were plenty of problems throughout this lab. Working with the Serial Monitor was a little difficult to work out. I did like that the lab built on itse lf and 
                we were able to create a finished game with everything that we learned. Overall this was an enjoyable lab that helped me get familiar with the Arduino board.
