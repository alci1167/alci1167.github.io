                The Shelf was the final project of "Form". The project involved creating a physical object with our new skills.
                This shelf was a large project that I designed with a medium I've never used before. The initial sketches were very optimisitic which turned out too much to handle.

            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/Page1 (1).jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 37.45%">
                <img src="/img/Page2 (1).jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 37.45%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The project had different progress stages. Including renderings of the the shelf and drawings outlining the dimensions.

            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/bookshelf12_1.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 65%">
                <img src="/img/bookshelfadf_3 (2).jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 65%">
            </div>

            <p>
                This is an unfinished project. The shelf was very hard to make. With the lack of proper tools and training, I was unable to finich the shelves properly.
                Although the project is unfinished, it was a great learning experience.
