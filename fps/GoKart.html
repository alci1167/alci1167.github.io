                "Go-Kart" was created using SketchUp. This kart was designed as a "possible" addition to Mario Kart. 
            </p>

            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/refrences.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 28.25%">

                <img src="/img/sketches1.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 37.45%">
            </div>

            <p>
                These refrences and sketches were the first steps to creating the design on SketchUp. SketchUp isn't the best tool fo curves and natural shapes, which resulted in a
                difficult process to create the design. This project also helped devlope skills in setting up different perspectives and images of the design.

            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/perspective.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 43.25%">
                <img src="/img/perspective2.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 37.45%">
            </div>

            <div id = "images">
                <img src="/img/top.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 35%">
                <img src="/img/side.jpg" alt="placeholder" class="feature" style="width: 43.5%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The design features the kart with a green, yellow, red, and black livery, that includes the nuber 10 and "Form". The design also showcases a parachute with a matching pattern.
